# ADR: Communication Style with API Gateway

## Title
Communication Style with API Gateway

## Status
Accepted

## Motivation
The existing architecture relies heavily on synchronous communication, limiting resilience and flexibility. Adopting a more robust communication style is necessary to support the microservices architecture, ensuring efficient and reliable interactions between services.

## Decision Drivers
- Need for improved resilience and fault tolerance.
- Requirement for flexible and efficient service communication.
- Desire for centralized management of API traffic and security.

## Main Decision
The decision is to implement an API Gateway as the central communication hub for all microservices. The API Gateway will handle routing, authentication, and rate limiting, providing a single entry point for client requests. Services will communicate asynchronously where possible, using messaging queues like SQS or SNS to decouple interactions and improve resilience.

## Alternatives
- Direct service-to-service communication without an API Gateway.
- Use of a service mesh for communication management.

## Pros
- Main decision:
  - Pros:
    - Centralizes API management and security.
    - Supports asynchronous communication for improved resilience.
    - Simplifies client interactions with a single entry point.
- Direct service-to-service:
  - Pros:
    - Reduces initial setup complexity.
    - Allows direct, low-latency communication.
- Service mesh:
  - Pros:
    - Provides advanced traffic management and observability.
    - Enhances security and resilience through service-level policies.

## Cons
- Main decision:
  - Cons:
    - Introduces additional complexity in configuration and management.
    - Potentially increases latency due to centralized routing.
- Direct service-to-service:
  - Cons:
    - Lacks centralized management and security.
    - Increases coupling between services.
- Service mesh:
  - Cons:
    - Requires significant infrastructure and operational overhead.
    - Complexity in setup and management.

## Consequences
Implementing an API Gateway will improve resilience, security, and manageability of service communication. It introduces some complexity but provides a scalable and flexible solution for handling client requests and inter-service interactions.

## Validation
Validation to be defined in future iterations.
