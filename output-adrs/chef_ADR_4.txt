# ADR: Distributed Deployment Strategy

## Title
Distributed Deployment Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Motivation
The existing architecture lacks distributed deployment, limiting fault tolerance and scalability. As the application transitions to a microservices architecture, deploying services across multiple availability zones will enhance fault tolerance and ensure high availability, critical for maintaining service reliability and performance.

## Decision Drivers
- Requirement for enhanced fault tolerance and high availability
- Need to improve scalability and performance
- Organizational goal to align with best practices for distributed systems

## Main Decision
The decision is to implement a distributed deployment strategy by deploying microservices across multiple AWS availability zones. This approach enhances fault tolerance by ensuring that services remain available even if one zone experiences an outage. It also supports scalability by allowing services to be deployed closer to users.

## Alternatives
- Single-zone deployment: Deploy all services within a single availability zone.
- Hybrid deployment: Deploy critical services across multiple zones while keeping others in a single zone.

## Pros
- Main decision:
  - Pros:
    - Enhances fault tolerance and high availability.
    - Supports scalability and performance improvements.
    - Aligns with best practices for distributed systems.
- Alternative 1:
  - Pros:
    - Simplicity in deployment and management.
    - Lower initial infrastructure costs.
- Alternative 2:
  - Pros:
    - Balances fault tolerance with infrastructure costs.
    - Allows gradual transition to full distributed deployment.

## Cons
- Main decision:
  - Cons:
    - Increases infrastructure complexity and costs.
    - Requires more sophisticated deployment and monitoring strategies.
- Alternative 1:
  - Cons:
    - Limits fault tolerance and high availability.
    - Risks service outages in case of zone failures.
- Alternative 2:
  - Cons:
    - May lead to inconsistent fault tolerance across services.
    - Partial benefits compared to full distributed deployment.

## Consequences
The distributed deployment strategy will enhance fault tolerance and high availability, ensuring service reliability and performance. It introduces additional complexity and costs but provides significant benefits in terms of resilience and scalability. This decision aligns with organizational goals of adopting best practices for distributed systems.

## Validation
Validation to be defined in future iterations.
