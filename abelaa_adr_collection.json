    "title": "Migration to Microservices Architecture",
    "status": "Accepted",
    "motivation": "The existing hybrid architecture, while incorporating a serverless component, remains largely monolithic, limiting scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. Migrating to a microservices architecture allows for independent scaling, deployment, and management of services, aligning the system with modern architectural practices and addressing current and future business needs.",
    "decision_drivers": [
      "Need for improved scalability and flexibility",
      "Desire for independent deployment and management of services",

      "Organizational shift towards modern architectural practices"
    ],
    "main_decision": "The decision is to migrate the application from a hybrid architecture to a fully microservices-based architecture. This involves decomposing the monolithic application into independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability, and deploying them as AWS Lambda functions. An API Gateway will be used to route requests to the appropriate services, facilitating synchronous communication. This approach addresses the need for scalability, flexibility, and resilience by allowing each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.",

    "consequences": "Migrating to a microservices architecture will improve scalability, flexibility, and resilience, allowing the system to better handle growth and change.
